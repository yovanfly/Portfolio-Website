        <h2>Canvas Redesign</h2>
        <p>
          This was my senior capstone project: a redesign of Canvas, specifically <strong>asu.instructure.com</strong>. 
          My goal was to consolidate redundant views and improve usability by merging related content into streamlined pages. 
          Canvas often forces users to click through multiple pages with minimal navigation feedback, leading to a poor experience for both students and administrators.
          I followed an SDLC approach using sprint-based planning and regular feedback from focus groups. 
          The result was a complete UI mockup using ASU branding, consistent color systems, and streamlined flows for home, calendar, and contact pages. 
          Feedback highlighted improved clarity and accessibility, especially on the Contact and Home pages.
          The final prototype can be viewed at
