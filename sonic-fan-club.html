        <h2>Sonic Fan Club</h2>
        <p>
          This was a class project and a personal little website that I wanted to try making on my own. 
          The focus of the project was to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. 
          I needed to make a website that showcased different capabilities including, 
          but not limited to: JavaScript event handling, dark mode, forms, dynamic HTML and CSS, and a random math game. 
          I tackled the project piece by piece, constantly referring to my old work and online resources such as w3schools for refreshers. 
          For development, I focused on creating the CSS first as it was easiest to move forward knowing in advance how my color schemes would affect my readability. 
          Following the CSS was the HTML then finally the JS code. The project was completed on time.
